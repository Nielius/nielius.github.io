    <h1>Niels uit de Bos - Personal site - under construction</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Niels uit de Bos. This site is actively under construction as of August 2024. Please check back later for more info.</p>
<p>Short overview of my current and past interests and skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>AI Alignment research</em>: since the beginning of 2024 and I have been working full-time on AI alignment research (specifically mechanistic interpretability) as part of <a href="https://www.matsprogram.org/">MATS 5.0 and 5.1</a>, mentored by <a href="https://agarri.ga/">Adrià Garriga-Alonso</a>. Some of the work I did there: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15166">Adversarial Circuit Evaluation</a> (workshop paper at the ICML Mechanistic Interpretability workshop; <a href="https://x.com/uit_bos/status/1820781390981365917">tweet thread</a>) and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4YiFiPGYMazidFgQ2/an-evaluation-of-circuit-evaluation-metrics-1">An evaluation of circuit evaluation metrics (LessWrong Post)</a>. I have more thoughts about both of these topics -- happy to talk about it!</li>
<li><em>Software engineering</em>: I&#39;ve been programming since I was 12, and have now done it professionally for about 5 years. I&#39;ve seen and appreciated different extremes of programming style: very robust and well-crafted code at <a href="https://www.zopa.com/">Zopa</a> and <a href="https://www.gresearch.com/">G-Research</a>  (finance) on one end, and very quickly written and huge value providing code at <a href="https://depict.ai/">Y-Combinator ML-startup Depict</a>. I thought that doing AI experiments would fall somewhere on this spectrum, but it turns out that in many ways it&#39;s a different beast altogether.</li>
<li><em>Mathematics</em>: I did a <a href="https://duepublico2.uni-due.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/duepublico_derivate_00070040/Diss_uitdeBos.pdf">Ph.D.</a> in algebraic geometry (geometric Langlands) at the University of Duisburg-Essen advised by <a href="https://www.esaga.uni-due.de/jochen.heinloth/">Jochen Heinloth</a>.</li>
<li>Formal verification: did a lot of <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a> with a group of friends during the pandemic. (Once they rename the language to The Rocq Prover this sentence will sound less ridiculous.) E.g. we <a href="https://github.com/awalterschulze/regex-reexamined-coq">worked on this</a> and studied theory together.</li>
<li>Linguistics: I don&#39;t only like programming languages, I also like natural languages a lot! I know many things about many languages, won the Dutch computational linguistic Olympiad, speak Dutch, English, French, German, know a fair bit of Latin, Ancient Greek, Swedish, Hindi, Esperanto, and am currently learning Mandarin Chinese.</li>
